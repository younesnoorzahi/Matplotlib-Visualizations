<h1>Pendulum</h1>
<p>To simulate a pendulum in Python, you can use various libraries such as matplotlib for visualization and numpy for numerical computations. Below is an example of how to simulate a simple pendulum using the Euler method for numerical integration.</p>

<h1>Step 1: Install Required Libraries</h1>
<p>First, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:</p>

```pip install numpy matplotlib```

<span>Step 2: Write the Pendulum Simulation Code in this File (Simulation Code.py)</span>


<h1>Explanation:</h1>

- <h3>Parameters:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>g is the acceleration due to gravity.</li>
  <li>L is the length of the pendulum.</li>
  <li>theta0 is the initial angle of the pendulum.</li>
  <li>omega0 is the initial angular velocity.</li>
  <li>t_max is the maximum time for the simulation.</li>
  <li>dt is the time step for the Euler method.</li>
</ul>
